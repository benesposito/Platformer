This is a game in Unity I made last year which I decided just to upload here

Note: A lot of this was me experimenting with code which I copied from a tutorial on raycasting. I am not able to find the exact video I watched, but I wanted to note that most of this code is NOT mine. I will probably experiment with Unity games next time I get interested (probably after robotics season when I remember how much I love programming and need to fill the void).
